h1. Elexis Marlovits Unsupported Classes Sniffer

*** This plugin is inteded for developers ***

See discussion on "now unsupported data types in extinfo" in elexis develop mailing list.

This sniffer pluging looks for unsupported classes in all extinfo-kind fields in the db.

This looks for ALL unsupported classes, even the ones already catched in  ch.elexis.core.data/src/ch/elexis/core/data/util/CompatibleObjectInputStream.java.

The view can be found in "Other" / "Marlovits Unsupported Classes Sniffer"
It should be self explanatory.
At the top there is a text field "Search for unresolved classes in the following fields"
Here you can define any fields you wish to sniff on.
One entry per line, each entry is formatted <tableName>:<fieldName>
Empty lines are ignored
If you wish to disable an entry you can just add ":_" at the end of an entry

This is not a fully sized plugin, cancel not implemented.
